# My-Portfolio

For this week's challenge, I built a personalized portfoilo website using my knowledge of flexbox, mediaqueries, and CSS variables. Most of the projects and links are placeholders except for the Run Buddy project.

## The following image depicts a screenshot of the completed portfolio:
