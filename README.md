# My Portfolio

## Description

For this project, I built a personalized portfoilo website using my knowledge of HTML, CSS, flexbox, and media queries. This portfolio allows employers to learn about who I am and showcase my skills and projects. The About Me section contains a short bio about my experience and personality. The Works sections includes five deployed projects as well as group projects where I've demonstrated my ability to collaborate with others. The Contact Me section has links to my contact information including my GitHub and LinkedIn profiles. Additional technologies include Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons.
