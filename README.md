# My Portfolio

## Description

For this project, I built a personalized portfoilo website using my knowledge of HTML, CSS, flexbox, and media queries. This portfolio allows employers to learn about who I am and showcase my skills and projects. Additional technologies include Google Fonts and Font Awesome icons. Projects that are not yet completed are indicated with a "Placeholder" message when hovered over.
